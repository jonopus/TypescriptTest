	 * The interface definition for a PureMVC Proxy.

	 * In PureMVC, <code>IProxy</code> implementors assume these responsibilities:
	 * <UL>
	 * <LI>Implement a common method which returns the name of the Proxy.
	 * <LI>Provide methods for setting and getting the data object.
	 *
	 * Additionally, <code>IProxy</code>s typically:
	 * <UL>
	 * <LI>Maintain references to one or more pieces of model data.
	 * <LI>Provide methods for manipulating that data.
	 * <LI>Generate <code>INotifications</code> when their model data changes.
	 * <LI>Expose their name as a <code>public static const</code> called <code>NAME</code>, if they are not instantiated multiple times.
	 * <LI>Encapsulate interaction with local or remote services used to fetch and persist model data.
